# Sudoku Solver
> This project was created after learning the basics of python and inspired by my passion for Sudoku 
It uses advanced sudoku solving techniques such as doubles, triples, and candidate line 
Finally, the last step of the implementation involves guessing, which uses the idea of tree recursion 
The files that start with "test" are tests for every little progress I made so I could assure the code I have written so far works before building upon it.
